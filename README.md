# Real-Time Chat Application

This is a simple real-time chat application where users can join different chat rooms or create their own chat rooms. Users can send and receive messages in real-time.


## Features

1. Allow users to create/join chat rooms by entering a unique room ID.
2. Enable users to send and receive messages in real-time within a chat room.
3. Display a list of active users in the chat room.
4.  Implement a private messaging feature between users.
5. Implement message history, so the chat persists even if the user leaves and rejoins.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders: `ui` and `server`.

- **ui**: Contains the front-end code written in TypeScript using BUN for web sockets.
- **server**: Contains the back-end code also written in TypeScript using BUN for handling web sockets.
